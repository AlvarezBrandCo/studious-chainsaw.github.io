            <h1>Hi, my name is Joseph Conyers,</h1>
            <p>
              and I’m an educator, entrepreneur, and mentor. I grew up in the beautiful town of Savannah Georgia pursuing my two passions: music and meteorology. I didn’t always see myself becoming a professional musician, but as I continued my journey with the bass, I saw music as something that could take me to new places across the country and even the world. After graduating from the Curtis Institute for Music, I performed with several orchestras across the country before joining the Philadelphia Orchestra in 2010. Since 2014 I have also enjoyed a second life as an artist of the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center. As a seasoned professional musician, I have also earned positions as double bass faculty at both Juilliard and Temple University. As the founder of Project 440, I hope to use music to uplift students so they can reach new heights and open up new worlds of possibility.

          <h2>He served as principal bass</h2>
          <p>
             of the Philadelphia Virtuosi Chamber
            Orchestra, with which he traveled extensively and recorded on the
            Naxos label. He also served as assistant principal bass for Symphony
            in C (formerly the Haddonfield Symphony). He has been a fellowship
            student and held principal positions at numerous music festivals,
            including the Tanglewood Music Center, the Aspen Music Festival and
            School, the Verbier Music Festival in Switzerland, the Brevard Music
            Center, and the Britten-Pears Music Festival in England. Mr. Conyers
            has performed with a number of major orchestras, including the
            Boston and Detroit symphonies, the Minnesota Orchestra, and the City
            of Birmingham Symphony in a number of prestigious venues, including
            Carnegie Hall, Kennedy Center, Lincoln Center, and the Musikverein
            in Vienna. In 1999 Mr. Conyers was one of the first guests on NPR’s
            From the Top with host Christopher O’Riley in one of its pilot
            shows. In 2007 he was named one of “30 Leaders 30 and Under” by
            Ebony magazine.
          </p>
          <h2>He was the inaugural recipient</h2>
          <p>
             of the Sanford Allen Award from the
            Sphinx Competition, and in February of 2010 he was the first Sphinx
            Competition laureate to serve on the distinguished jury panel for
            the Competition. Mr. Conyers is committed to education and community
            engagement through music. He was heavily involved in developing the
            curriculum for the Atlanta Symphony’s Sound Learning program, which
            integrates music into the school curriculum at local elementary
            schools. Mr. Conyers has taught at numerous summer music festivals,
            including the Masterworks Festival in Winona Lake (IN), the New York
            State Summer School of the Arts, and the Philadelphia International
            Music Festival. He also collaborates with Time for Three bassist
            (and Curtis classmate) Ranaan Meyer for the development of Wabass
            Workshop, an institute for the 21st-century bass player. Last fall
            Mr. Conyers was added to the double bass teaching faculty at Temple
            University in Philadelphia. For much of 2010 Mr. Conyers was
            featured in a television commercial as a part of a Mutual of Omaha
            advertisement campaign. His “aha moment” was about his inspiration
            founding a nonprofit in Savannah called Project 440
            (project440.org).
          </p>
          <p>
            Formerly known as MusicAlive!, Project 440 has reached thousands of
            youths, exposing children and adults to classical music throughout
            the Savannah region. Mr. Conyers serves on the board of directors of
            the American String Teachers Association as artist representative,
            the Board of Overseers for the Curtis Institute of Music, and the
            National Advisory Board for the Atlanta Music Project. He performs
            on the “Zimmerman/Gladstone” 1802 Vincenzo Pp normo double bass,
            which he has affectionately named “Norma.”
